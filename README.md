Analysis of Greek hero names in the US census data.

## Hipsters and Greek heroes
How many people are called Antigone?         
I am reading Stephen Fry's Heroes, which is a lovely book. I am getting barraged by names, lots of names, some "amazing".      
This led me to wonder what the frequency of these names is.

## Data
Consequenly I used the [US census data](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) to find out the frequency of names.        
For the names of Greek heroes, I copy-pasted several Category pages from Wikipedia.
This is not perfect and required several iterations â€”say, "Where is Heracles?" or "Where is Hippolyta?".
It has several contaminants, but they are generally manageable.       
One major issue is that there are many name variants, especially given that I am searching Ancient Greek names that are translitterated to Latin or English with different schema.
A case in point is "Hercules", which is the Latin variant of the name "Heracles".


## Trends
Unsurprisingly, the distribution is a power law like curve, with some familiar names utterly dominant.

Excessively long names such as Halirrhothius are absent. Curiously, the longest names at 15 and 14 letters
